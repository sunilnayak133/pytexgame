# pytexgame
A Bare Bones Python Text Game, soon to be made into a Text Game Engine.

The map is read from the locmap.txt file
Format for the file is mentioned within the python file. 
Maps that are input are assumed to be correct, a check for correctness isn't built in yet. 

The game now ends when you reach the final destination.

TODO:
Adding characters and interactions with the characters
Adding states for the game based on interactions with characters and places visited
Adding an inventory for the player
Adding items to be found at the places and with the characters
